# Authentication
Lyrics are unique. That is why every lyrics and exported content is protected by an authentication encryption system. It makes it impossible :
- To edit any exported / published lyrics and to pretend being the actual owner
- To claim being the owner of published lyrics without tracing back to the original author with a time-stamped official proof
- To not retrieve the original owner **metadata** of **published lyrics**
- To publish lyrics with identical or really similar content to another **published** lyrics without warning its owner

## Limitations
Authentication cannot prevent :
- Simple text copy pasting for unpublished lyrics.
- Back-track theft: the re-use and downloading of packed back-tracks is **permitted, easy and even supported**.

# Export vs Publication
**Exporting** is the action of *sharing, downloading, transfering* an **.ollo** file using :
- Apollo or any derivative
- Manual editing of the package using any type of tool

**Publishing** is the action of *uploading* an Apollo file metadata via the secured online Auth protocol. It requires a paid account (basically to finance the server charges). 
- Publication enables to authenticate any **.ollo** file and securely trace every **published** updates. 
- A co-author can then in turn authenticate **its own published versions** 
- If the original author decides to merge any other version (published or not) and publishes it, the merged version's author is added as **co-author**
# Manual editing
Manual editing of any file contained in an **.ollo** package is possible, since the **.ollo** are basically zip files. 

However it is heavily unrecommended, since **passive authentication** use a mathematical process to check the conformity of every files on the original Apollo application, even **offline**. 

The edited file will be tagged and considered as a **pirate file**. 
# Pirate files
Pirate files are files that suffered an unconform editing using an Apollo derivative (which means any system designed to open an .ollo file other than the original Apollo application) or any other tool.

Pirate files are not considered as dangerous or illegal, simply unconform to the **Authentication process**.

Practically, **they just do not have any encryption SHAs.**

They will be treated as normal files but with the following limitations :
- Pirate files can be **opened, edited, and even re-exported normally**. However, exported versions and future editings will be treated as Pirate files.
- Pirate files won't contain any **main author**. Every editing will be treated as **co-authored**. 
- Pirate files cannot be **published** in any way.

Valid and published files that ended up treated as pirate files might be recovered after an investigation.
